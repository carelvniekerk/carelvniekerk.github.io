# Work experience

<a href="https://www.hhu.de/">
  <img src="/images/hhu.png" alt="alt text" height="40" width="75">
</a>  2024-Present: Postdoctoral Researcher

-   Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany
-   Dialogue Systems and Machine Learning Group
-   Lamarr Fellow Network Ramp Up Project
-   Lecturing: Implementing Transformer Models Practical Series
-   **Agentic Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**: Led the development of a MARL framework for telephonic dialogue systems, enabling coordinated decision-making between router and expert agents with explicit credit assignment. This approach improved routing accuracy by **over 15 percentage points** in a production-level dialogue product.
-   [**HydraXcel**](https://github.com/carelvniekerk/HydraXcel): Sole developer and maintainer of an open-source, configuration-driven deep learning experiment launcher. Integrated Facebook Hydra, Hugging Face Accelerate, and the UV workflow to support **scalable multi-GPU and distributed training**. The framework enables seamless, scalable **multi-GPU and distributed training** for the research team.

-   **HPC \& Cloud Training Infrastructure**: Designed and implemented Hydra launcher plugins enabling transparent execution of experiments on **SLURM**-managed HPC clusters and via **SkyPilot** on cloud platforms. This infrastructure enabled high-throughput experimentation and rapid switching between compute backends without code changes.

-   **Academic Leadership**: Supervised multiple Master's theses focused on MARL and task-oriented dialogue. Designed and instructed the ``Implementing Transformers'' course, guiding students through building the **Attention Is All You Need** architecture from first principles in **PyTorch**, with emphasis on attention mechanics, training dynamics, and debugging. Achieved a 95\% course pass rate.

</a>  2019-2024: Doctoral Candidate and Research Scientist

-   Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany
-   Doctoral Candidate in the Dialogue Systems and Machine Learning Group
-   Lecturing: Implementing Transformer Models Practical Series
-   **Uncertainty-Aware Decision Making**: Developed computationally efficient methods for uncertainty quantification in intent classification in collaboration with Yandex Research. Integrated uncertainty features into reinforcement learning policies, improving real-user interaction success by **5 percentage points**. Designed an **Active Learning** strategy that achieved full-dataset performance using only **16\% of expert annotations**.
-   **ConvLab-3 Dialogue Systems Toolkit**: Core developer of a large-scale dialogue system toolkit in collaboration with Tsinghua University and Microsoft Research. Architected a unified data format enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous datasets and models, significantly reducing engineering overhead for generalisation and reinforcement learning research. The toolkit has been adopted in **30+ research papers** spanning RL- and LLM-based dialogue agents.
-   **Young Researchers Roundtable on Spoken Dialogue Systems (YRRSDS)**: Co-organised the 2022 edition collocated with SIGDIAL in Edinburgh. Managed the digital infrastructure and branding for the workshop and contributed to **sponsorship acquisition**.

# Projects

-   Uncertainty Estimation in Natural Language Understanding: Designed a framework for estimating and then leveraging uncertainty in dialogue systems to improve user experience and robustness during interactive tasks.
-   Dialogue System Evaluation via AWS Mechanical Turk: Designed and developed a custom evaluation interface enabling large-scale human-in-the-loop testing of dialogue agents in AWS.
-   Uncertainty Estimation in LLMs: Designed and implemented a custom reinforcement learning framework to improve answer trustworthiness in LLMs.
-   Generative AI Feedback Summarization Agent: Designed and implemented a web-based summarization tool that transcribes verbal feedback and generates topic-wise summaries across multiple subjects. Full stack engineered the application using FastAPI and JavaScript with PUG, integrated with OpenAI APIs.
-   Entity Sentiment Prediction from Media Reports: Designed, trained, and deployed an AI model to predict entity-specific sentiment analysis from multilingual media sources, enabling real-time sentiment scores for clients in the banking industry.
