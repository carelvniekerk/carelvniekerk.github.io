About Me
======
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Dialogue Systems and Machine Learning](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning.html) group at Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, under Prof. Milica Gašić. My research is currently part of the 'Lamarr Fellow Network Ramp Up' project, with a special interest in understanding uncertainty in Large Language Models (LLMs). This follows my successful completion of a PhD, which I received with magna cum laude.

I have 10 years of experience across academia and industry, with a focus on machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. I have over five years of experience conducting cutting-edge AI research and have spent a year in AI consulting, applying state-of-the-art methods to real-world problems.

Previously, I co-authored the 2020 SIGDial best paper “TripPy”, and before that, I worked as an AI consultant at NGA Risksecure. My academic background includes a Master’s degree in Mathematical Statistics from the University of Pretoria, where I graduated with distinction and served as a teaching and research assistant. My goal is to improve dialogue systems by making them smarter and more reliable, through a deeper understanding of LLMs.

My interests are in Data and AI, focusing on designing and implementing AI and genAI solutions. I have designed, developed and deployed genAI applications with real-world impact, including the implementation of AI agents on the Google Cloud Platform to automate human evaluation tasks. My research includes work with both API-based and on-premise large language models (LLMs), with a particular focus on reinforcement learning for LLM fine-tuning.

I have published at leading venues such as EMNLP, ACL and IEEE, with contributions centred on generative modelling and trustworthy AI.  I also have experience in mentorship, having successfully supervised several Master’s and Bachelor’s theses.


Highlights
------

* **9 April 2024** - Today I recieved my Ph.D. with magna cum laude. My thesis, titled "Uncertainty Estimation, Management, and Utilisation in Human-Computer Dialogue", explores the role of uncertainty in Language Understanding and its implications for dialogue systems. I am grateful for the support of my advisor, Prof. Milica Gašić, and the members of the Dialogue Systems and Machine Learning group at Heinrich Heine University.
* **8 December 2023** - Today we presented the [ConvLab 3](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab-3) toolkit at EMNLP 2023. ConvLab 3 is a user-friendly and versatile platform for training and deploying dialogue systems.
* **2 June 2023** - We're thrilled to announce the acceptance of our paper, [ChatGPT for Zero-shot Dialogue State Tracking: A Solution or an Opportunity?](https://carelvniekerk.github.io/publication/2023-chatgptdst) at ACL 2023. In this innovative research, we demonstrate how ChatGPT excels in zero-shot Dialogue State Tracking (DST), setting a new industry standard. Our preliminary findings hint at the transformative potential of in-context learning capabilities in these models, particularly for developing dynamic and dedicated dialogue state trackers.
