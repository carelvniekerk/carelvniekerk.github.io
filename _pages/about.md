About Me
======
I am a PhD candidate in the [Dialogue Systems and Machine Learning](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning.html) group led by Prof. Milica Gašić at the Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf. I currently work in the "Towards Intelligent Dialogue Systems" project, funded by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, where I am a co-author of the 2020 SIGDial best paper “TripPy". Before this, I worked as an AI consultant at NGA Risksecure. During my postgraduate studies, I worked as a teaching and research assistant at the University of Pretoria, where I obtained my Masters degree with distinction in Mathematical Statistics.
