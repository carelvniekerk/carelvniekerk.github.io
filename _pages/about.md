About Me
======
I am a doctoral candidate in the [dialogue systems and machine learning group](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning.html) at HHU in Düsseldorf, under the supervision of Prof. Milica Gasic. My research interest lies in task-oriented dialogue, dialogue belief tracking, and uncertainty estimation. I am interested in developing and applying new techniques for uncertainty estimation. This includes analysing uncertainty during belief tracking, and also the downstream effects of uncertainty estimates on die policy of a dialogue system. I also find the evaluation of human interaction with systems very interesting.

I am from South Africa and received my Master’s degree in Mathematical Statistics with distinction and the University of Pretoria in 2018. Currently, I am working on the towards intelligent dialogue systems project, funded by the Alexander von Humboldt foundation, where I am a co-author of the 2020 Sigdial best paper TripPy.
