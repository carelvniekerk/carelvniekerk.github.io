About Me
======
I am a Research Scientist and Doctoral student in the [Dialogue Systems and Machine Learning group](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning.html) at HHU in DÃ¼sseldorf. I was born in South Africa and received a Masters degree in Mathematical Statistics with distinction at the University of Pretoria in 2018. My main research interest lie in distributional deep learning and the understanding of deep learning models. I am currently working on Dialogue Belief Tracking and Uncertainty in Deep Learning for the next generation of Dialogue Systems.
