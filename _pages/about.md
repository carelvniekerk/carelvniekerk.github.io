About Me
======
I am a research scientist and doctoral student in the [dialogue systems and machine learning group](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning.html) at HHU in Düsseldorf. I am interested in developing and applying new techniques for uncertainty estimation in deep learning.

I am from South Africa and received a Master’s degree in Mathematical Statistics with distinction at the University of Pretoria in 2018. After my Master’s I worked as a consultant at a risk management company, designing and implementing machine learning solutions for clients. These applications included both natural language processing and image classification tasks. My interests in uncertainty for deep learning encouraged me to start my doctorate.

I am currently working on uncertainty in language understanding. I focus on developing techniques and applying these methods to language understanding in dialogue systems.
