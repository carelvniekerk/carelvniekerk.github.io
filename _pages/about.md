About Me
======
I am a PhD candidate in the [Dialogue Systems and Machine Learning](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning.html) group led by Prof. Milica Gašić at the Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf. I currently work in the "Towards Intelligent Dialogue Systems" project, funded by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, where I am a co-author of the 2020 SIGDial best paper “TripPy". Before this, I worked as an AI consultant at NGA Risksecure. During my postgraduate studies, I worked as a teaching and research assistant at the University of Pretoria, where I obtained my Masters degree with distinction in Mathematical Statistics.

Highlights
------
* **2 June 2023** - We're thrilled to announce the acceptance of our paper, [ChatGPT for Zero-shot Dialogue State Tracking: A Solution or an Opportunity?](https://carelvniekerk.github.io/publication/2023-chatgptdst) at ACL 2023. In this innovative research, we demonstrate how ChatGPT excels in zero-shot Dialogue State Tracking (DST), setting a new industry standard. Our preliminary findings hint at the transformative potential of in-context learning capabilities in these models, particularly for developing dynamic and dedicated dialogue state trackers.
* **30 November 2022** - We've just launched the [ConvLab 3](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab-3) toolkit to the public. It introduces a crucial, unified Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) data format. With this, datasets like MultiWOZ and SGD are now available in a single, harmonized format, simplifying model loading and eliminating the need for additional coding. This reduces the cost and effort involved in adapting new models or datasets. ConvLab 3 also offers an streamlined framework for building TOD dialogue system pipelines and executing reinforcement learning. Coupled with the integration of state-of-the-art user simulators like GenTUS, ConvLab 3 provides a user-friendly and versatile platform for training and deploying dialogue systems.
